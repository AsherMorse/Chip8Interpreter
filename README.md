# CHIP-8 Interpreter/Emulator for macOS

This project is a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter/emulator designed specifically for macOS, with future plans to port it to iOS/iPadOS. CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language developed in the mid-1970s, aimed at simplifying video game programming on microcomputers.

## Features

- **CHIP-8 Emulation**: Mostly functional CHIP-8 emulation to run  classic CHIP-8 programs.
- **Customizable Display**: Options to customize the display colors.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Use your Mac's keyboard as the CHIP-8 keypad.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AsherMorse/Chip8Interpreter.git
```

2. Open Chip8Interpreter.xcodeproj in Xcode.

3. Select your target destination (your Mac).

4. Press the Run button or Cmd + R to build and run the project.

## Usage

After launching the app, you can import a CHIP-8 [program](https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive/) and use your keyboard to interact with the program just like you would with the original CHIP-8 keypad.
